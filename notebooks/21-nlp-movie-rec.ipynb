Among them are an American Doctor who does not pay much attention to his wife and an Austrian Lieutenant, who decides to seduce her. He manages to befriend the couple so that, when the Doctor has to leave to help a local physician, he asks the Lieutenant to look after his wife. When the Lieutenant becomes too pressing, she promises to leave with him but asks him to give her more time. During the night, she puts a letter under the door of his bedroom.\\r\\nThe Doctor goes on a climbing expedition with the Lieutenant, who had been bragging about his exploits as a mountaineer. In fact, he is not in very good shape and the Doctor must help him to reach the summit. In the process, the Doctor finds his wife's letter in the pocket of the Lieutenant's jacket, but before he can read it, the Lieutenant throws it away. He asks the Lieutenant whether his wife had promised to leave with him and the Lieutenant gives a positive answer. The Doctor decides to leave him on the summit and starts his descent, despite the Lieutenant now saying that he has been lying because he thought the Doctor would not believe the truth. On his way back, the Doctor finds his wife's letter, in which she had written that she loved only her husband and asked the Lieutenant not to bother her any longer with his attentions. While pondering whether he should go back to get the Lieutenant, he loses his balance and falls down. When the Doctor is finally saved by soldiers, he asks them to go and help the Lieutenant. Before they can reach him, the Lieutenant, attacked by vultures, falls to his death from the precipice.[3]</td>\n",

       "      <td>The NDR series robot \"Andrew\" (Robin Williams) is introduced in 2005 into the Martin family home to perform housekeeping and maintenance duties. The family's reactions range from acceptance and curiosity, to outright rejection, and deliberate vandalism by their rebellious older daughter, Grace (Lindze Letherman), who treats him as a mere robot and continues with her rebellious ways while growing up. This leads Andrew to discover that he can both identify emotions and reciprocate in kind. When Andrew accidentally breaks a figurine belonging to \"Little Miss\" Amanda (Hallie Kate Eisenberg), he carves a replacement out of wood, as way to apologize to her. The family is astonished by this creativity and “Sir” Richard Martin (Sam Neill) takes Andrew to his manufacturer, to inquire if all the robots are like him. The CEO of the company, Dennis Mansky (Stephen Root), sees this development as a problem and wishes to scrap Andrew. Angered, Richard takes Andrew home and allows him to pursue his own development, encouraging Andrew to educate himself in the humanities.\\r\\nYears later, Martin again takes Andrew to NorthAm Robotics for repairs following an accident in which his thumb is accidentally cut off. Richard ensures first that Andrew's personality will remain un-tampered with. Andrew requests his face be altered to convey the emotions he feels but cannot fully express, while he is being repaired. Twelve years later, Andrew eventually asks for his freedom, much to Richard's dismay. He grants the request, but banishes Andrew so he can be 'completely' free. Andrew builds himself a home and lives alone. In 2048, Andrew sees Richard one last time on his deathbed, where he apologizes for banishing him.\\r\\nAndrew goes on a quest to locate more NDR series robots to discover if others have also developed sentience. After nearly twenty years of failure, he finds Galatea (Kiersten Warren), an NDR robot that has been given feminine attributes and personality. These, however, are simply aspects of her programming and not something which she spontaneously developed. Galatea is owned by Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt), son of the original NDR robot designer. Burns works to create more human-looking robots, but is unable to attract funding. Andrew agrees to finance the research and the two join forces to revolutionize robotics. He meanwhile maintains contact with Amanda, who grew up, married, had a child, divorced and now has a granddaughter called Portia. After receiving human features, Andrew comes back home, and sees Amanda, now aged, with Portia, who is the same as her grandmother in her younger years (they are both played by Embeth Davidtz). Initially he has some troubles reintegrating into the family since now there is only Amanda who actually knows him, but he manages to befriend Portia. Some time later, Amanda passes away, leaving Andrew to realise that everyone he knows will die one day. Accepting this fact, Andrew decides to become human. With the help of Rupert, he creates a new type of mechanical organs that can be used both by him to become more human and used by humans as prosthetic organs. He gains a nervous system and lots of other organs that make him able to eat, to feel emotions and sensations, and also to have sexual intercourse. Eventually, Andrew becomes human enough to fall in love with Portia and, ultimately, she falls in love with him.\\r\\nOver the course of the next century, Andrew petitions the World Congress to recognize him as human, which would allow him and Portia to be legally married, but is rejected; the Speaker of the Congress explains that society can tolerate an everlasting machine, but argues that an immortal human would create too much jealousy and anger. Initially Andrew decides to make Portia live as much as possible through his medical inventions but after some decades she tells him that she can't and doesn't want to live forever, so one day she will refuse any more treatment. Andrew decides to make Burns inject blood into his system, thereby allowing him to age, and thus he begins to grow old alongside Portia. Andrew again attends the World Congress with Portia, both now appearing old and frail, and again petitions to be declared a human being.\\r\\nOn their death bed with life support, Andrew and Portia watch as the Speaker of the World Congress announces on television the court's decision: that Andrew is officially recognized as human, and (aside from \"Methuselah and other Biblical characters\") is the oldest human being in history at the age of two-hundred years old. The Speaker also validates the marriage between Portia and Andrew. Andrew dies while listening to the broadcast despite his life support, and Portia orders their nurse Galatea, a now recognizably-human android, to unplug her life support. The movie ends as Portia dies hand-in-hand with Andrew after she whispers \"See you soon\" to him.</td>\n",

Among them are an American Doctor who does not pay much attention to his wife and an Austrian Lieutenant, who decides to seduce her. He manages to befriend the couple so that, when the Doctor has to leave to help a local physician, he asks the Lieutenant to look after his wife. When the Lieutenant becomes too pressing, she promises to leave with him but asks him to give her more time. During the night, she puts a letter under the door of his bedroom.\\r\\nThe Doctor goes on a climbing expedition with the Lieutenant, who had been bragging about his exploits as a mountaineer. In fact, he is not in very good shape and the Doctor must help him to reach the summit. In the process, the Doctor finds his wife's letter in the pocket of the Lieutenant's jacket, but before he can read it, the Lieutenant throws it away. He asks the Lieutenant whether his wife had promised to leave with him and the Lieutenant gives a positive answer. The Doctor decides to leave him on the summit and starts his descent, despite the Lieutenant now saying that he has been lying because he thought the Doctor would not believe the truth. On his way back, the Doctor finds his wife's letter, in which she had written that she loved only her husband and asked the Lieutenant not to bother her any longer with his attentions. While pondering whether he should go back to get the Lieutenant, he loses his balance and falls down. When the Doctor is finally saved by soldiers, he asks them to go and help the Lieutenant. Before they can reach him, the Lieutenant, attacked by vultures, falls to his death from the precipice.[3]  \n",
       "13423  The NDR series robot \"Andrew\" (Robin Williams) is introduced in 2005 into the Martin family home to perform housekeeping and maintenance duties. The family's reactions range from acceptance and curiosity, to outright rejection, and deliberate vandalism by their rebellious older daughter, Grace (Lindze Letherman), who treats him as a mere robot and continues with her rebellious ways while growing up. This leads Andrew to discover that he can both identify emotions and reciprocate in kind. When Andrew accidentally breaks a figurine belonging to \"Little Miss\" Amanda (Hallie Kate Eisenberg), he carves a replacement out of wood, as way to apologize to her. The family is astonished by this creativity and “Sir” Richard Martin (Sam Neill) takes Andrew to his manufacturer, to inquire if all the robots are like him. The CEO of the company, Dennis Mansky (Stephen Root), sees this development as a problem and wishes to scrap Andrew. Angered, Richard takes Andrew home and allows him to pursue his own development, encouraging Andrew to educate himself in the humanities.\\r\\nYears later, Martin again takes Andrew to NorthAm Robotics for repairs following an accident in which his thumb is accidentally cut off. Richard ensures first that Andrew's personality will remain un-tampered with. Andrew requests his face be altered to convey the emotions he feels but cannot fully express, while he is being repaired. Twelve years later, Andrew eventually asks for his freedom, much to Richard's dismay. He grants the request, but banishes Andrew so he can be 'completely' free. Andrew builds himself a home and lives alone. In 2048, Andrew sees Richard one last time on his deathbed, where he apologizes for banishing him.\\r\\nAndrew goes on a quest to locate more NDR series robots to discover if others have also developed sentience. After nearly twenty years of failure, he finds Galatea (Kiersten Warren), an NDR robot that has been given feminine attributes and personality. These, however, are simply aspects of her programming and not something which she spontaneously developed. Galatea is owned by Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt), son of the original NDR robot designer. Burns works to create more human-looking robots, but is unable to attract funding. Andrew agrees to finance the research and the two join forces to revolutionize robotics. He meanwhile maintains contact with Amanda, who grew up, married, had a child, divorced and now has a granddaughter called Portia. After receiving human features, Andrew comes back home, and sees Amanda, now aged, with Portia, who is the same as her grandmother in her younger years (they are both played by Embeth Davidtz). Initially he has some troubles reintegrating into the family since now there is only Amanda who actually knows him, but he manages to befriend Portia. Some time later, Amanda passes away, leaving Andrew to realise that everyone he knows will die one day. Accepting this fact, Andrew decides to become human. With the help of Rupert, he creates a new type of mechanical organs that can be used both by him to become more human and used by humans as prosthetic organs. He gains a nervous system and lots of other organs that make him able to eat, to feel emotions and sensations, and also to have sexual intercourse. Eventually, Andrew becomes human enough to fall in love with Portia and, ultimately, she falls in love with him.\\r\\nOver the course of the next century, Andrew petitions the World Congress to recognize him as human, which would allow him and Portia to be legally married, but is rejected; the Speaker of the Congress explains that society can tolerate an everlasting machine, but argues that an immortal human would create too much jealousy and anger. Initially Andrew decides to make Portia live as much as possible through his medical inventions but after some decades she tells him that she can't and doesn't want to live forever, so one day she will refuse any more treatment. Andrew decides to make Burns inject blood into his system, thereby allowing him to age, and thus he begins to grow old alongside Portia. Andrew again attends the World Congress with Portia, both now appearing old and frail, and again petitions to be declared a human being.\\r\\nOn their death bed with life support, Andrew and Portia watch as the Speaker of the World Congress announces on television the court's decision: that Andrew is officially recognized as human, and (aside from \"Methuselah and other Biblical characters\") is the oldest human being in history at the age of two-hundred years old. The Speaker also validates the marriage between Portia and Andrew. Andrew dies while listening to the broadcast despite his life support, and Portia orders their nurse Galatea, a now recognizably-human android, to unplug her life support. The movie ends as Portia dies hand-in-hand with Andrew after she whispers \"See you soon\" to him.  \n",

He falls in love with Indu (Subhashri), but Indu's uncle Dinakar (Nassar) opposes this. Nevertheless, Indu is determined to wed her first love.

Ali's task becomes more complicated as an innocent Muslim is killed by armed police on the Underground. Ali (Naseeruddin Shah), a Lahore-born British citizen married to an English woman with two children, is himself distrusted by his colleagues, despite his long service in the Metropolitan Police.  "

       "      <td>the film is set during operation dynamo, the evacuation of surrounded british and french troops from the beaches of dunkirk, france between 26 may and 4 june 1940, during the second world war. events are seen mostly from the viewpoints of two people, a civilian in england, newspaper reporter charles foreman (bernard lee) and a british soldier in france, corporal \"tubby\" binns (john mills).\\r\\nforeman fails to rouse his complacent readers on the home front from the luring notion of a \"phoney war\" (october 1939 – april 1940) before it is too late. his acquaintance john holden (richard attenborough) owns a small factory manufacturing buckles and is quite pleased with his profits from the phoney war. in may 1940, the battle of france begins when the germans invade and rapidly advance, threatening to trap much of the allied forces in a pocket in northern france and overwhelm them.\\r\\ncorporal \"tubby\" binns (john mills), his platoon leader lieutenant lumpkin and a depleted section return to camp after blowing up a bridge, only to discover that their company has pulled out during the night, leaving them alone in france. one man and a lorry have been left to wait for them, but the driver and lumpkin are killed in a german air attack, leaving tubby in charge of a five-man squad with no idea what the situation is or where to go. it is up to tubby to keep his increasingly demoralised men on the move. they dodge the advancing germans and reach a royal artillery battery camp. there they receive some food, but lose private frazer while repelling a german column. they are then ordered to head north with two other stragglers to try to link up with the rest of the british expeditionary force (bef). the party spends the night in a farmhouse, but at dawn a german patrol breaks in and private dave bellman is shot badly in the chest, forcing tubby to leave him behind, as it is bellman's only chance of receiving medical attention. eventually, they encounter a royal air force lorry and get a lift to dunkirk. they join the rest of the bef and tens of thousands of french soldiers who are hoping to be evacuated to england.\\r\\nthe situation becomes so desperate that general john vereker, viscount gort, the commander of the bef, pulls out two divisions against orders to reinforce the wavering belgians. the admiralty commandeers all available civilian boats to help evacuate the troops from the beaches. foreman insists on taking his motorboat vanity himself, despite warnings of the danger. other boat owners follow his example. holden does the same with some reluctance at first, but his lack of commitment is soon forgotten.\\r\\nthe soldiers on the beaches are subjected to regular aerial bombing and strafing. tubby and his men get aboard a ship, only to have it blown up and sunk before it can depart. when they get back to the beach, pte barlow is hit in the face and taken to the aid station. after ferrying soldiers to the larger vessels, foreman's boat is destroyed by a bomber. he survives and is picked up by holden in the heron. when heron's engine breaks down, private mike russell, one of tubby's men, effects repairs while foreman and teenage crewman frankie go ashore to survey the scene. foreman and tubby discuss who is responsible for the debacle. during a sunday morning church parade, foreman is fatally wounded in an attack by luftwaffe ju 87 stuka dive bombers. holden, tubby and the rest of his men arrive safely back in britain.</td>\n",

       "19380  the film is set during operation dynamo, the evacuation of surrounded british and french troops from the beaches of dunkirk, france between 26 may and 4 june 1940, during the second world war. events are seen mostly from the viewpoints of two people, a civilian in england, newspaper reporter charles foreman (bernard lee) and a british soldier in france, corporal \"tubby\" binns (john mills).\\r\\nforeman fails to rouse his complacent readers on the home front from the luring notion of a \"phoney war\" (october 1939 – april 1940) before it is too late. his acquaintance john holden (richard attenborough) owns a small factory manufacturing buckles and is quite pleased with his profits from the phoney war. in may 1940, the battle of france begins when the germans invade and rapidly advance, threatening to trap much of the allied forces in a pocket in northern france and overwhelm them.\\r\\ncorporal \"tubby\" binns (john mills), his platoon leader lieutenant lumpkin and a depleted section return to camp after blowing up a bridge, only to discover that their company has pulled out during the night, leaving them alone in france. one man and a lorry have been left to wait for them, but the driver and lumpkin are killed in a german air attack, leaving tubby in charge of a five-man squad with no idea what the situation is or where to go. it is up to tubby to keep his increasingly demoralised men on the move. they dodge the advancing germans and reach a royal artillery battery camp. there they receive some food, but lose private frazer while repelling a german column. they are then ordered to head north with two other stragglers to try to link up with the rest of the british expeditionary force (bef). the party spends the night in a farmhouse, but at dawn a german patrol breaks in and private dave bellman is shot badly in the chest, forcing tubby to leave him behind, as it is bellman's only chance of receiving medical attention. eventually, they encounter a royal air force lorry and get a lift to dunkirk. they join the rest of the bef and tens of thousands of french soldiers who are hoping to be evacuated to england.\\r\\nthe situation becomes so desperate that general john vereker, viscount gort, the commander of the bef, pulls out two divisions against orders to reinforce the wavering belgians. the admiralty commandeers all available civilian boats to help evacuate the troops from the beaches. foreman insists on taking his motorboat vanity himself, despite warnings of the danger. other boat owners follow his example. holden does the same with some reluctance at first, but his lack of commitment is soon forgotten.\\r\\nthe soldiers on the beaches are subjected to regular aerial bombing and strafing. tubby and his men get aboard a ship, only to have it blown up and sunk before it can depart. when they get back to the beach, pte barlow is hit in the face and taken to the aid station. after ferrying soldiers to the larger vessels, foreman's boat is destroyed by a bomber. he survives and is picked up by holden in the heron. when heron's engine breaks down, private mike russell, one of tubby's men, effects repairs while foreman and teenage crewman frankie go ashore to survey the scene. foreman and tubby discuss who is responsible for the debacle. during a sunday morning church parade, foreman is fatally wounded in an attack by luftwaffe ju 87 stuka dive bombers. holden, tubby and the rest of his men arrive safely back in britain.  \n",
